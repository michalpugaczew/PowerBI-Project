# Northwind Report - PowerBI Project

Hello everyone,

Thanks for reaching out my repository.

Here you can find the report:

https://www.novypro.com/project/northwind-traders-report---portfolio-project-power-bi

Please see the description below, which include more details about the project and analyze the data.


# Introduce

The report is based on a free data base "Northwind" and has been created for non-commercial purposes to show my skills as a Power BI Analyst. It is dedicated to help the business unit manage, monitor major KPI and maintain the current processes in the company.

The database contains the sales data for Northwind Traders, a fictitious specialty foods exportÂ­/import company.

# Data Model

![image](https://github.com/michalpugaczew/PowerBI-Project/assets/152793313/8e3b6d8e-ec82-4be8-81b6-bf3840fe5601)

The model includes couple additional tables:

**factPromoPL** 

**factShipLevelPL**

To make the report more realistic, I have created fictitious budget plans to allow better comparision on these two KPI's. For the Promotion in % it's set for 7% for each month and for the Ship Level it's set for 95% for each month.

**factShipRealization** table includes information about the current realization time of orders, required order date, deviation from the PL and general information if the order is delayed or not. 

The table was created with the following SQL query:


    SELECT O.OrderID
    	,DATEDIFF(DAY, O.OrderDate, O.ShippedDate) ShipDaysAC
    	,DATEDIFF(DAY, o.OrderDate, O.RequiredDate) ShipDaysPL
    	,DATEDIFF(DAY, DATEDIFF(DAY, o.OrderDate, O.RequiredDate), DATEDIFF(DAY, O.OrderDate, O.ShippedDate)) 'PL Deviation'
    	,CASE
    	WHEN DATEDIFF(DAY, DATEDIFF(DAY, O.OrderDate, O.ShippedDate), DATEDIFF(DAY, o.OrderDate, O.RequiredDate)) < 0 THEN 1
    	WHEN DATEDIFF(DAY, DATEDIFF(DAY, O.OrderDate, O.ShippedDate), DATEDIFF(DAY, o.OrderDate, O.RequiredDate)) IS NULL THEN NULL
    	ELSE 0
    	END 'Is delayed?'
    FROM 
    	Orders O


**dimDate** is a calendar table which has been created using DAX Language:

    DimDate = 
    ADDCOLUMNS (
    CALENDAR ("1996-01-01", "1999-12-31"),
    "DateInt", FORMAT ( [Date], "YYYYMMDD" ),
    "Year", YEAR ( [Date] ),
    "Monthnumber", FORMAT ( [Date], "MM" ),
    "MonthNameShort", FORMAT ( [Date], "mmm", "en-US" ),
    "MonthNameLong", FORMAT ( [Date], "mmmm" , "en-US"),
    "DayOfWeekNumber", WEEKDAY ( [Date] ),
    "Week Number", WEEKNUM([Date]),
    "DayOfWeek", FORMAT ( [Date], "dddd" ),
    "DayOfWeekShort", FORMAT ( [Date], "ddd" ),
    "Quarter", "Q" & FORMAT ( [Date], "Q" ),
    "YearQuarter", FORMAT ( [Date], "YYYY" ) & "/Q" & FORMAT ( [Date], "Q" )
    )



# Calculations correctness check - DAX vs SQL

Here you can find major KPI calculated in the MS SQL Server compared to the calculations created in Power BI:

We will focus on following KPI's:

**Sales AC** - total current sales with the discounts included

**Orders AC** - total number of orders

**Ship % AC** - percentage of ships realized on-time

**Promo % AC** - percentage share of the promotion in the total sales


SQL Calculations:

# Custom SQL analyze - year 1997

In this part, we will perform a simple analyze using SQL language. At first, we will take a look on employees and their productivity:

As we can see, Margaret Peacock was the one with the most orders completed in the whole year. Now let's check, whose orders earned the biggest revenue for the company:


        WITH employeeanalyze
             AS (SELECT Concat(e.firstname, ' ', e.lastname)                  Employee,
                        Sum(od.quantity * od.unitprice * ( 1 - od.discount )) Sales,
                        Avg(od.quantity * od.unitprice * ( 1 - od.discount )) AvgSales,
                        (SELECT Avg(od.quantity * od.unitprice * ( 1 - od.discount ))
                         FROM   [order details] od
                                JOIN orders o
                                  ON o.orderid = od.orderid
                         WHERE  Year(o.orderdate) = 1997)
                        'TotalAvgSales'
                 FROM   employees e
                        JOIN orders o
                          ON o.employeeid = e.employeeid
                        JOIN [order details] od
                          ON od.orderid = o.orderid
                 WHERE  Year(o.orderdate) = 1997
                 GROUP  BY Concat(e.firstname, ' ', e.lastname))
        SELECT employee,
               Format(sales, '### ###')         Sales,
               Format(avgsales, '### ###')      AvgSales,

                 WHEN Round(avgsales, 0) = Round(totalavgsales, 0) THEN '='
                 ELSE '-'
               END                              AS Deviation
        FROM   employeeanalyze
        ORDER  BY Cast(sales AS INT) DESC; 


**Output:**

Again, we can see that Margaret Peacock is way ahead comparing to the rest of employees in total sales, but very curious is a thing, that she has not the best average sales.  Let's see, how she performed in that case during the year on a bar chart:

![image](https://github.com/michalpugaczew/PowerBI-Project/assets/152793313/899dd4d0-eb40-4137-8312-778ffea5d60e)


Margaret Peacock was above the average for total company only in 5 months, which means she was below 50%. We can see a strong peak in Januray. Let's see, what happened in that period:


        SELECT Concat(e.firstname, ' ', e.lastname)
               Employee,
               o.orderid,
               Count(od.productid)
               '# Items',
               Format(Sum(od.quantity * od.unitprice * ( 1 - od.discount )), '### ###')
               Sales
        FROM   [order details] od
               JOIN orders o
                 ON od.orderid = o.orderid
               JOIN employees e
                 ON o.employeeid = e.employeeid
        WHERE  Year(o.orderdate) = 1997
               AND Month(o.orderdate) = 1
        GROUP  BY Concat(e.firstname, ' ', e.lastname),
                  o.orderid
        ORDER  BY 1 DESC; 


**Output:**

We can see an order **NO 10417**, which definitely increased the average for Mrs. Peacock. Let's get deeper into that order:


        SELECT o.orderid,
               p.productname,
               od.quantity,
               od.unitprice
        FROM   [order details] od
               JOIN orders o
                 ON od.orderid = o.orderid
               JOIN employees e
                 ON o.employeeid = e.employeeid
               JOIN products p
                 ON od.productid = p.productid
        WHERE  o.orderid = 10417
        ORDER  BY 3 DESC; 


**Output:**


![image](https://github.com/michalpugaczew/PowerBI-Project/assets/152793313/35e63f2a-79b9-463e-afd6-f6920dd2a7b8)


The peak was caused a big order (50qty) on an expensive product named 'CÃ´te de Blaye' and it had a significant impact on a monthly average result.


But don't remember that number of orders may have a big impact on the total sales value. Let's check if there exists any correlation:

        WITH correlation
             AS (SELECT Concat(E.firstname, ' ', e.lastname)                  Employee,
                        Sum(od.quantity * od.unitprice * ( 1 - od.discount )) Sales,
                        Count(DISTINCT OD.orderid)                            Orders
                 FROM   [order details] od
                        JOIN orders o
                          ON od.orderid = o.orderid
                        JOIN employees e
                          ON o.employeeid = e.employeeid
                 WHERE  Year(O.orderdate) = 1997
                 GROUP  BY Concat(E.firstname, ' ', e.lastname))
        SELECT Round(( Avg(sales * orders) - ( Avg(sales) * Avg(orders) ) ) / (
                            Stdevp(sales) * Stdevp(orders) ), 2)
               'Pearson Linear Correlation'
        FROM   correlation 


**Output:**

We can see that there is strong, significant correlation between number of orders and total sales. This means that as the number of orders increases, total sales also increase and that explains the good result of one of the employees, mrs Peacock.


**A few words in conclusion**


Thank you for reading the entire descritpion. The purpose of the project was about showing sample of my skills as  a Power BI Analyst. If you are interested in cooperation with me or you have any question, you can contact with me via my LinkedIn profile:
