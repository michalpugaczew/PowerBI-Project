# Northwind Report - PowerBI Project

Hello everyone,

Thanks for reaching out my repository.

Here you can find the report:

https://www.novypro.com/project/northwind-traders-report---portfolio-project-power-bi

Please see the description below, which include more details about the project and analyze the data.


# Introduce

The report is based on a free data base "Northwind" and has been created for non-commercial purposes to show my skills as a Power BI Analyst. It is dedicated to help the business unit manage, monitor major KPI and maintain the current processes in the company.

The database contains the sales data for Northwind Traders, a fictitious specialty foods exportÂ­/import company.

# Data Model

![image](https://github.com/michalpugaczew/PowerBI-Project/assets/152793313/8e3b6d8e-ec82-4be8-81b6-bf3840fe5601)

The model includes couple additional tables:

**factPromoPL** 

**factShipLevelPL**

To make the report more realistic, I have created fictitious budget plans to allow better comparision on these two KPI's. For the Promotion in % it's set for 7% for each month and for the Ship Level it's set for 95% for each month.

**factShipRealization** table includes information about the current realization time of orders, required order date, deviation from the PL and general information if the order is delayed or not. 

The table was created with the following SQL query:


    SELECT O.OrderID
    	,DATEDIFF(DAY, O.OrderDate, O.ShippedDate) ShipDaysAC
    	,DATEDIFF(DAY, o.OrderDate, O.RequiredDate) ShipDaysPL
    	,DATEDIFF(DAY, DATEDIFF(DAY, o.OrderDate, O.RequiredDate), DATEDIFF(DAY, O.OrderDate, O.ShippedDate)) 'PL Deviation'
    	,CASE
    	WHEN DATEDIFF(DAY, DATEDIFF(DAY, O.OrderDate, O.ShippedDate), DATEDIFF(DAY, o.OrderDate, O.RequiredDate)) < 0 THEN 1
    	WHEN DATEDIFF(DAY, DATEDIFF(DAY, O.OrderDate, O.ShippedDate), DATEDIFF(DAY, o.OrderDate, O.RequiredDate)) IS NULL THEN NULL
    	ELSE 0
    	END 'Is delayed?'
    FROM 
    	Orders O


**dimDate** is a calendar table which has been created using DAX Language:

    DimDate = 
    ADDCOLUMNS (
    CALENDAR ("1996-01-01", "1999-12-31"),
    "DateInt", FORMAT ( [Date], "YYYYMMDD" ),
    "Year", YEAR ( [Date] ),
    "Monthnumber", FORMAT ( [Date], "MM" ),
    "MonthNameShort", FORMAT ( [Date], "mmm", "en-US" ),
    "MonthNameLong", FORMAT ( [Date], "mmmm" , "en-US"),
    "DayOfWeekNumber", WEEKDAY ( [Date] ),
    "Week Number", WEEKNUM([Date]),
    "DayOfWeek", FORMAT ( [Date], "dddd" ),
    "DayOfWeekShort", FORMAT ( [Date], "ddd" ),
    "Quarter", "Q" & FORMAT ( [Date], "Q" ),
    "YearQuarter", FORMAT ( [Date], "YYYY" ) & "/Q" & FORMAT ( [Date], "Q" )
    )



# Calculations correctness check - DAX vs SQL

Here you can find major KPI calculated in the MS SQL Server compared to the calculations created in Power BI:

We will focus on following KPI's:

**Sales AC** - total current sales with the discounts included

**Orders AC** - total number of orders

**Ship % AC** - percentage of ships realized on-time

**Promo % AC** - percentage share of the promotion in the total sales


SQL Calculations:
